# Design Decisions & Implementation Notes

## Database Design

**Choice of SQLite:**
- Lightweight and perfect for a demo application
- No external database server required
- Good performance for small to medium datasets

**Schema Design:**
- Used CHECK constraints for enum-like fields (priority, status)
- Added created_at and updated_at timestamps for audit trail
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields (status, priority, due_date)

## API Design

**RESTful Principles:**
- Clear resource-based endpoints
- Proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Consistent response format

**Filtering & Sorting:**
- Implemented query parameter-based filtering
- Support for multiple filter combinations
- Flexible sorting with field and direction

## Frontend Architecture

**Component Structure:**
- Modular React components with single responsibilities
- Prop-based data flow
- Centralized API service layer

**State Management:**
- Used React hooks for local state
- Lifted state up for shared data (tasks, insights)
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Smart Insights Logic

**Rule-Based Analysis:**
- Priority distribution analysis
- Due date proximity calculation
- Status-based workload assessment
- Overdue task detection

**Insight Generation:**
- Natural language generation based on computed metrics
- Context-aware messaging (empty state, completion celebration)
- Progressive disclosure of information

## Performance Considerations

**Backend:**
- Efficient SQL queries with proper filtering
- Database-level sorting
- Minimal data transformation

**Frontend:**
- Efficient re-renders with proper React patterns
- CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout performance
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Security & Validation

**Input Validation:**
- Backend validation for all inputs
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through React's built-in escaping

## Potential Improvements

Given more time, I would add:

1. **User Authentication**
   - JWT-based login system
   - User-specific task management

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Task categories/tags
   - Recurring tasks
   - File attachments
   - Email notifications

3. **Enhanced UI/UX**
   - Drag-and-drop task ordering
   - Calendar view
   - Data visualization charts
   - Keyboard shortcuts

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Proper migration system
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Docker containerization

## Testing Strategy

The application is structured to be easily testable:
- Backend controllers are separated from routes
- Frontend components are modular and pure
- API service is abstracted for mocking
Running the Application
Start the Backend:

bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
Start the Frontend:

bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Access the Application:
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
